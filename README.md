<CONNECT-FOUR>
  - For my Unit One Proposal Iâ€™ve chosen Connect Four, my favorite rainy day recess game in school. 
  - Connect Four is a two player game in which players start with  21 chips each and take turns dropping them into a 7 X 6 vertical board. When a player is able to get four in a row either vertically, horizontally or diagonally the game is over.
