# Connect-4

## About:
  - For my Unit One Project I chose to do Connect Four, my favorite rainy day recess game in school.
  - Connect Four is a two player game in which players start with  21 chips each and take turns dropping them into a 7 X 6 vertical board. When a player is able to get four in a row either vertically, horizontally or diagonally the game is over.
  - My game includes sound effects, and a light/dark mode based on user preference.

## Getting Started:
 - Play the game here - <a href='https://clairecarden-connect-four.surge.sh/'>Connect-4</a>
 - To play, click on the top circle in the row you choose to place your chip, alternating between red and yellow until there is a winner.
 - After a winner is declared, click restart to play again!
