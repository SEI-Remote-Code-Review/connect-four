<h1>Connect-4</h1>
<ul>
  <li>For my Unit One Project I chose to do Connect Four, my favorite rainy day recess game in school.</li> 
  <li>Connect Four is a two player game in which players start with  21 chips each and take turns dropping them into a 7 X 6 vertical board. When a player is able to get four in a row either vertically, horizontally or diagonally the game is over.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ul>
    <li>To play, click on the top circle in the row you choose to place your chip, alternating between red and yellow until there is a winner.</li>
</ul>
